        <p>I love reading and writing.When I was young, I always spent every evening with my parents to share the books I read. My favorite book is The Little Prince.
        I published a novel online when I was studying at my primary school. <i class="fas fa-book"></i> </p>

        <p>I started playing piano when I was five. A cousin of mine was playing musical instruments at that time, therefore I was interested in it. <i class="fas fa-music"></i> </p>
